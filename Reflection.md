 ##  Documentation  

### Main Concepts I Used  
For this project, I focused on creating a responsive website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **media queries**. I worked on making the layout adapt to different devices like desktops, tablets, and phones. I also used **flexbox** to align and space items, which made everything look neat and balanced.  

### New Things I Learned  
While working on this project, I learned a lot of new things:  
- How to write media queries to make designs responsive.  
- How flexbox can make layout adjustments so much easier.  
- Adding icons using **Font Awesome**, which made the website look modern.  
- Styling buttons to look professional and interactive.  

##  Reflection  

### What I Learned  
This project helped me understand the basics of building a responsive website. It showed me how important it is to make designs work well on all screen sizes. I also learned how to identify and fix design problems. Overall, it gave me more confidence to take on bigger web development tasks in the future.  

### Challenges I Faced  
1. **Service Card Alignment**  
   - **Problem:** The service cards in the "Services" section were overlapping and didn’t look good on smaller screens.  
   - **Solution:** I used flexbox and added media queries so the cards stack vertically on mobile devices.  

2. **Hero Image Size**  
   - **Problem:** The hero image was too big on mobile screens and broke the layout.  
   - **Solution:** I used media queries to resize the image and set a `max-width` for better control.  

##  Clarity & Organization  
I tried to keep this reflection clear and simple. Each part focuses on what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I solved them. Writing in an organized way helped me reflect on the project and communicate my ideas better.  

## Conclusion  
Working on this project was a great learning experience. It taught me not just the technical skills but also the importance of testing designs on different devices. While there were some challenges, solving them helped me grow as a beginner web developer. I’m excited to keep learning and improving.
