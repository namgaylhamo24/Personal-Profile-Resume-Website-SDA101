**Main Concepts Applied:**
**Semantic HTML**: I used clear HTML tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>` to organize the landing page. This helps improve accessibility and makes the code easier to read.
   
For layout management, I mainly used **Flexbox** in the services and contact sections to space the elements evenly and make them responsive. For more complex parts like the **hero section** and **project display**, I opted for **CSS Grid** for better control over spacing and alignment.

I added **Font Awesome** icons for social media links and buttons, like "Download CV." I used `<i>` tags and styled them with CSS for better size and hover effects, making the design look nicer and work better.

**New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:**

- **CSS Grid**: I improved my understanding of CSS Grid, building on my Flexbox knowledge to create more detailed layouts, especially in the hero section.
- **Figma to HTML Conversion**: This project helped me better convert design prototypes into code, focusing on important details like text style, spacing, and colors.

- **Browser Testing**: I learned to test and debug websites across multiple browsers to ensure layout consistency, handling minor differences in how browsers render CSS.

**What I Learned:**

This project taught me how important it is to have a clear structure and clean code when creating a webpage from a design. I learned to use CSS Flexbox and Grid together to handle different layouts and the need for responsive design to ensure the site looks good on various devices.

I improved my knowledge of **web performance** by optimizing images to make them load faster without losing quality.

**Challenges Faced:**

1. **Hero Section Alignment**: I struggled to align the hero section (image and text) properly on different devices. Elements were overlapping on smaller screens. I fixed this by using **relative positioning** for the image and **Flexbox** for the text to adjust the layout dynamically.

2. **Spacing in Services Section**: I also had trouble with spacing between the service cards; it looked too cramped on smaller screens. I addressed this by applying Flexbox properties like `justify-content: space-around` and adjusting the margins for consistent spacing.

3. **Importing Icons**: I faced a challenge while styling the icons and adding hover color effects in CSS. Initially, I forgot to link the Font Awesome CDN, so the icons werenâ€™t appearing on the webpage. To solve this, I consulted friends who were familiar with the issue and searched online for a solution.

I learned how important it is to test designs on different screen sizes and browsers early on. This experience has made me more confident in handling similar problems in the future and improved my skills with CSS layouts and responsive design.
